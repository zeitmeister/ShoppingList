# ShoppingList

A simple shoppinglist-app that I created based on my own preferences.
Connected to firebase.
Using a RecyclerView and a FirebaseRecyclerAdapter, a 'ShoppingItem' class and a class 'TotalSum' that just holds, adds to and subtracts
from the sum of all the items in the list, given that the user enters the price of the grocery.
